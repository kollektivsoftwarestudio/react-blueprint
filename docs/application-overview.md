# ðŸ’» Application Overview

The application copies all features from: [bulletproof-react](https://github.com/alan2207/bulletproof-react).

The application is pretty simple. Users can create teams where other users can join, and they start discussions on different topics between each other.

A team is created during the registration if the user didn't choose to join an existing team and the user becomes the admin of it.
