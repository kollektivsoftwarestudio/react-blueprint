# react-blueprint

# Contribution

react-blueprint is heavily based on Alan Alickovic's work: https://github.com/alan2207/bulletproof-react. The project has been rebuilt from the ground up using the latest software packages and adjusted to teach react-blueprints software architecture principles. By keeping the same structure and general feature set, it should be easier for developers to evaluate both approaches and learn from them.
